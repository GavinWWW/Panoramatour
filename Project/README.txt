When you have opened this folder, you will only need to open the pano2vr file called panoramatour. 
(You will get a warning about the entrance file is missing. It is only showing that is because i changed the name of it. Just press ok)
Click on the icon called 'open output file'and you will see the panorama tour.
After that, You should see a HTML file. 


To open the integrated web server, you will need to go on tools>Integrated web server. But before that, you will need 
to go on settings from Files and then click on web server. make sure that the port is set to 'auto' and 
the 'Open HTMl output' is ticked.
after that, restart the server  and then type in the address at the top. If it shows 'No prefixes found', you will need to exit the browser 
open up the panorama tour first from the computer first so it generates it onto the integrated web server.
Click on or type in the address again and it should work. 
Next click on:
C:/Users/user/Desktop/project/  ->  Output ->  panoramatour.html
Then it will work.
(This will only work if you leave the integrated web browser on)

 ps: Make sure that the output folder is in same folder with the Pano2vr file
